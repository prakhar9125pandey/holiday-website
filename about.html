            <p>When I think of the holiday season I immediately think of home cooked meals, hot chocolate, <br>
                and family. I have always loved the holiday season because of all the warm feelings it evokes.<br>
                 Unfortunately, a few years ago, we had to do Christmas completely different because my grandfather<br>
                  was in the hospital. I was devastated; my family isn’t very close, but I could always count on<br> 
                  everyone coming together for a true Christmas dinner. The walk to my Grandfather’s room seemed <br>
                  to take forever, but when I finally got there I realized holiday dinners could still be perfect<br>
                   because it is not the number of people in the family that matters, it is the bond we all share <br>
                   that counts. Walking up to the hospital felt different, colder even, and not just<br>
                   “At about this time they are getting ready to serve dinner, so I would say he’s rearranging<br> 
                   everything his sisters put on the table.” My mom laughed, “Gosh, I could just imagine the <br>
                   uproar! I bet his sister is threatening to kick him out of the room.”
I laughed to myself, imagining my aunt getting frustrated, so annoyed that her perfectly organized<br>
 place settings are being moved. She was always crazy about that stuff, everything had to be a <br>
 certain way, and if it wasn’t she immediately fixed it. The laughter suddenly stopped; we had finally <br>
 reached the elevator, which meant it was game time.
My sister and I always raced to see to who would press the little up button on the elevator. <br>
I started to walk faster, quickly looking back and forth between my sister and the elevator door
